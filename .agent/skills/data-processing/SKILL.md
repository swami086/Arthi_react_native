# Data Processing Skill

This skill provides the agent with enhanced capabilities for handling complex data transformation tasks.

## Capabilities
- **Extraction**: Identify and extract tabular data from fuzzy text or logs.
- **Cleaning**: Normalize date formats, handle missing values, and deduplicate records.
- **Analysis**: Calculate aggregates (sum, mean, median) and identify trends.

## How to use
When you need to process a large dataset or clean up messy logs:
1. Provide the data or the path to the file.
2. Ask the agent to "Use the data-processing skill to analyze this."

## Scripts
(None currently - this is a demonstration of the instruction-based capability)
